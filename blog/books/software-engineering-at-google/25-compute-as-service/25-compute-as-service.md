> containerization for which small resource footprints and short runtimes are expected.
> This led Google’s engineers designing Borg in 2003 to look to different solutions, end‐
> ing up with containers—a lightweight mechanism based on cgroups (contributed by
> Google engineers into the Linux kernel in 2007) and chroot jails, bind mounts and/or
> union/overlay filesystems for filesystem isolation. Open source container implemen‐
> tations include Docker and LMCTFY.
> Over time and with the evolution of the organization, more and more potential isola‐
> tion failures are discovered. To give a specific example, in 2011, engineers working on
> Borg discovered that the exhaustion of the process ID space (which was set by default
> to 32,000 PIDs) was becoming an isolation failure, and limits on the total number of
> processes/threads a single replica can spawn had to be introduced. We look at this
> example in more detail later in this chapter.
> Rightsizing and autoscaling
> The Borg of 2006 scheduled work based on the parameters provided by the engineer
> in the configuration, such as the number of replicas and the resource requirements.
> Looking at the problem from a distance, the idea of asking humans to determine the
> resource requirement numbers is somewhat flawed: these are not numbers that
> humans interact with daily. And so, these configuration parameters become them‐
> selves, over time, a source of inefficiency. Engineers need to spend time determining
> them upon initial service launch, and as your organization accumulates more and
> more services, the cost to determine them scales up. Moreover, as time passes, the
> program evolves (likely grows), but the configuration parameters do not keep up.
> This ends in an outage—where it turns out that over time the new releases had
> resource requirements that ate into the slack left for unexpected spikes or outages,
> and when such a spike or outage actually occurs, the slack remaining turns out to be
> insufficient.
> The natural solution is to automate the setting of these parameters. Unfortunately,
> this proves surprisingly tricky to do well. As an example, Google has only recently
> reached a point at which more than half of the resource usage over the whole Borg
> fleet is determined by rightsizing automation. That said, even though it is only half of
> the usage, it is a larger fraction of configurations, which means that the majority of
> engineers do not need to concern themselves with the tedious and error-prone bur‐
> den of sizing their containers. We view this as a successful application of the idea that
> “easy things should be easy, and complex things should be possible”—just because
> some fraction of Borg workloads is too complex to be properly managed by rightsiz‐
> ing doesn’t mean there isn’t great value in handling the easy cases.

> (although with higher latency). However, there is a clear trade-off here: how much to
> spend on the redundancy to mitigate the risk of an outage when cache capacity is lost.
> In a similar vein to caching, data might be pulled in from external storage to local in
> the warm-up of an application, in order to improve request serving latency.
> One more case of using local storage—this time in case of data that’s written more
> than read—is batching writes. This is a common strategy for monitoring data (think,
> for instance, about gathering CPU utilization statistics from the fleet for the purposes
> of guiding the autoscaling system), but it can be used anywhere where it is acceptable
> for a fraction of data to perish, either because we do not need 100% data coverage
> (this is the monitoring case), or because the data that perishes can be re-created (this
> is the case of a batch job that processes data in chunks, and writes some output for
> each chunk). Note that in many cases, even if a particular calculation has to take a
> long time, it can be split into smaller time windows by periodic checkpointing of state
> to persistent storage.
> Connecting to a Service
> As mentioned earlier, if anything in the system has the name of the host on which
> your program runs hardcoded (or even provided as a configuration parameter at
> startup), your program replicas are not cattle. However, to connect to your applica‐
> tion, another application does need to get your address from somewhere. Where?
> The answer is to have an extra layer of indirection; that is, other applications refer to
> your application by some identifier that is durable across restarts of the specific
> “backend” instances. That identifier can be resolved by another system that the
> scheduler writes to when it places your application on a particular machine. Now, to
> avoid distributed storage lookups on the critical path of making a request to your
> application, clients will likely look up the address that your app can be found on, and
> set up a connection, at startup time, and monitor it in the background. This is gener‐
> ally called service discovery, and many compute offerings have built-in or modular
> solutions. Most such solutions also include some form of load balancing, which
> reduces coupling to specific backends even more.
> A repercussion of this model is that you will likely need to repeat your requests in
> some cases, because the server you are talking to might be taken down before it man‐
> ages to answer.14 Retrying requests is standard practice for network communication
> (e.g., mobile app to a server) because of network issues, but it might be less intuitive

> total size of the machine, no more serving jobs can be put in there, even if real utiliza‐
> tion of resources is only 30% of capacity. But we can (and, in Borg, will) put batch
> jobs in the spare 70%, with the policy that if any of the serving jobs need the memory
> or CPU, we will reclaim it from the batch jobs (by freezing them in the case of CPU
> or killing in the case of RAM). Because the batch jobs are interested in throughput
> (measured in aggregate across hundreds of workers, not for individual tasks) and
> their individual replicas are cattle anyway, they will be more than happy to soak up
> this spare capacity of serving jobs.
> Depending on the shape of the workloads in a given pool of machines, this means
> that either all of the batch workload is effectively running on free resources (because
> we are paying for them in the slack of serving jobs anyway) or all the serving work‐
> load is effectively paying for only what they use, not for the slack capacity they need
> for failure resistance (because the batch jobs are running in that slack). In Google’s
> case, most of the time, it turns out we run batch effectively for free.
> Multitenancy for serving jobs
> Earlier, we discussed a number of requirements that a compute service must satisfy to
> be suitable for running serving jobs. As previously discussed, there are multiple
> advantages to having the serving jobs be managed by a common compute solution,
> but this also comes with challenges. One particular requirement worth repeating is a
> discovery service, discussed in “Connecting to a Service” on page 528. There are a
> number of other requirements that are new when we want to extend the scope of a
> managed compute solution to serving tasks, for example:
> • Rescheduling of jobs needs to be throttled: although it’s probably acceptable to
> kill and restart 50% of a batch job’s replicas (because it will cause only a tempo‐
> rary blip in processing, and what we really care about is throughput), it’s unlikely
> to be acceptable to kill and restart 50% of a serving job’s replicas (because the
> remaining jobs are likely too few to be able to serve user traffic while waiting for
> the restarted jobs to come back up again).
> • A batch job can usually be killed without warning. What we lose is some of the
> already performed processing, which can be redone. When a serving job is killed
> without warning, we likely risk some user-facing traffic returning errors or (at
> best) having increased latency; it is preferable to give several seconds of warning
> ahead of time so that the job can finish serving requests it has in flight and not
> accept new ones.
> For the aforementioned efficiency reasons, Borg covers both batch and serving jobs,
> but multiple compute offerings split the two concepts—typically, a shared pool of
> machines for batch jobs, and dedicated, stable pools of machines for serving jobs.
> Regardless of whether the same compute architecture is used for both types of jobs,
> however, both groups benefit from being treated like cattle.

> ences between the three terms, but there are more similarities, and the boundaries are somewhat blurred.
> organization’s growth (because both the number of teams and the number of datacen‐
> ters a team occupies are likely to grow). And after the choice to manage cattle is
> made, containers are a natural choice for management; they are lighter weight
> (implying smaller resource overheads and startup times) and configurable enough
> that should you need to provide specialized hardware access to a specific type of
> workload, you can (if you so choose) allow punching a hole through easily.
> The advantage of VMs as cattle lies primarily in the ability to bring our own operat‐
> ing system, which matters if your workloads require a diverse set of operating sys‐
> tems to run. Multiple organizations will also have preexisting experience in managing
> VMs, and preexisting configurations and workloads based on VMs, and so might
> choose to use VMs instead of containers to ease migration costs.
> What is serverless?
> An even higher level of abstraction is serverless offerings.23 Assume that an organiza‐
> tion is serving web content and is using (or willing to adopt) a common server frame‐
> work for handling the HTTP requests and serving responses. The key defining trait
> of a framework is the inversion of control—so, the user will only be responsible for
> writing an “Action” or “Handler” of some sort—a function in the chosen language
> that takes the request parameters and returns the response.
> In the Borg world, the way you run this code is that you stand up a replicated con‐
> tainer, each replica containing a server consisting of framework code and your func‐
> tions. If traffic increases, you will handle this by scaling up (adding replicas or
> expanding into new datacenters). If traffic decreases, you will scale down. Note that a
> minimal presence (Google usually assumes at least three replicas in each datacenter a
> server is running in) is required.
> However, if multiple different teams are using the same framework, a different
> approach is possible: instead of just making the machines multitenant, we can also
> make the framework servers themselves multitenant.  In this approach, we end up
> running a larger number of framework servers, dynamically load/unload the action
> code on different servers as needed, and dynamically direct requests to those servers
> that have the relevant action code loaded. Individual teams no longer run servers,
> hence “serverless.”
> Most discussions of serverless frameworks compare them to the “VMs as pets”
> model. In this context, the serverless concept is a true revolution, as it brings in all of
> the benefits of cattle management—autoscaling, lower overhead, lack of explicit pro‐
> visioning of servers. However, as described earlier, the move to a shared, multitenant,
